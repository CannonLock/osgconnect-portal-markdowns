# ci-connect-portal-markdowns

Separate repo to keep track of editable markdown files. These markdown files will render in the connect portal.

Form Descriptions:
These markdown files pertain to the content that appears on form input pop-overs (on hover). For best UI/UX, each should be limited to a one sentence description if possible.

Home Content:
Located in the `home_content` directory.
`home_text_headline.md` will update/contain the main page's headline

`home_text_rotating.md` will update/contain the rotating text on the main page. Each rotating text must be separated by a `/`

For example:
Access free opportunistic cycles/ Researcher facilitation/ High throughput computing

Sign-up Content:

`signup.md` will update/contain the headline of the sign-up page.
